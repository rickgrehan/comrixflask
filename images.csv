Radiation,vladradiation.png,Another inside joke involving Vlad and his countless displays.
Advanced Technology,zim.png,"This inside joke had to do with a caching system that our dev-ops hero, Paul, referred to as 'The Flushatron'. I guess you had to be there."
No More Fliers,votefliers.png,"I did this cartoon after the election last year, to show my relief that my mail would no longer be filled wit 'vote for __' fliers."
